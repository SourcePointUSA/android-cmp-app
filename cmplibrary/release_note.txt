* [DIA-4947](https://sourcepoint.atlassian.net/browse/DIA-4947) Integrate the (SourcepointUSA/mobile-core)[https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/mobile-core]. This is a major internal change. We moved the majority of our business logic, network, and data layers into our Kotlin Multiplatform library named mobile-core (mobile-core)[https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/mobile-core]. This change not only allows us to move faster when developing new features and addressing issues, but also helps us maintain a standardized approach across multiple platforms. The mobile team did its best to accomplish all of this while keeping the public interface untouched. [#846](https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/android-cmp-app/pull/846)
