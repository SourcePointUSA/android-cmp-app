* [DIA-5502](https://sourcepoint.atlassian.net/browse/DIA-5502) Fixed a regression affecting AndroidTV and the back button. [#856](https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/android-cmp-app/pull/856)
* [DIA-5417](https://sourcepoint.atlassian.net/browse/DIA-5417) Implemented the new setting `dismissMessageOnBackPress`. Set this to `false` if you wish to prevent the message from being dismissed when the back button is pressed. Default value is `true`.

* Removed `test_config` build file from `cmplibrary`'s, preventing it from being compiled on projects with minSdk version 21. [#858](https://github.com/SourcePointUSA/android-cmp-app/pull/858)
